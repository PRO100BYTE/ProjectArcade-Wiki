# ‚å® Keyboard

A standard keyboard can be used and will be recognized out of the box.

Buttons mapping can be found [HERE](../../navigation/navigation-keys.md#keyboard-navigation-keys)

Be aware that for Standalone emulators, AUTOCONFIGURATION will not always be available when using a keyboard. For these emulators it might be necessary to perform the mapping of keyboard keys directly in the emulator itself.
