# Welcome!

#### This is the official ProjectArcade wiki page containing all the necessary documentation

ProjectArcade is a shell created specifically for all fans of retrogaming. The software is intended for those who want to plunge into the nostalgic atmosphere of old games and enjoy their gameplay, but do not want to spend a lot of time and effort setting up emulators and looking for the right ROMs. This is a handy shell developed on the basis of open-source projects, namely RetroBat, EmulationStation and EmulatorLauncher, which allows you to launch any game from your retro collection in a few clicks.

You can use the navigation menu located in the left column to quickly find the information you need.

* If you are a beginner with ProjectArcade, you can head to the [Get started](get-started/prerequisites.md) section and let it guide you through the installation and first setup steps.
* If you are an advanced user and you are looking for information about a specific Game System, you can head over to the [Supported game systems](#) section, which will provide information about available emulators, BIOS requirements and detailed per-system features.
* The [Advanced features](#) section contains information about specific functionalities provided with ProjectArcade

PRO100BYTE Team with the RetroBat team is also including some specific [Tutorials](#) that will be enhanced by the developer based on common support requirements.
