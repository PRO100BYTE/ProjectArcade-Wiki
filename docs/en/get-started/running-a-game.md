Once you have finished your gaming session, you can press HOTKEY + START to close the emulator and return to the Game View.

### Choosing the Emulator

Usually, ProjectArcade defaults to the best / more stable emulator for each system. However, if the default emulator does not work for you, you can change the Emulator for a whole system or for a specific game.

The full list of available emulators per system can be found in the Supported Game Systems section of the wiki.
