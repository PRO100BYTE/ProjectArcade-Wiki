# Adding BIOS files

BIOS files are files required for some emulators to operate correctly.

### Location

For most systems, BIOS files must be placed in the `\bios` folder in your ProjectArcade installation:

A few systems need the bios files to be placed in subfolders. Refer to the individual system wiki page for detailed information about BIOS placement.

### Missing BIOS check

From the Game settings in the MAIN MENU, you have the possibility to perform a check for missing BIOS:

The missing BIOS appear with a broken chain icon. The ones where the md5 hash is not listed by ProjectArcade will appear with a  icon.

The detailed list of required BIOS for each system can be found in the individual Game System section of the wiki.

BIOS files are copyrighted and are therefore not included with ProjectArcade.

We can not legally distribute them, so you will need to supply your own.
